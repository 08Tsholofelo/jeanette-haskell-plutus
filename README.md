 Cardano Haskell Plutus University Program - TOBB Technologies

 Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for the Cardano Haskell Plutus University Program. This initiative is part of **Project Catalyst**, the world's largest decentralized innovation engine, and is focused on empowering students globally with Web3 and Cardano blockchain development skills.

My name is **Jeanette**, a student at **TOBB Technologies**, and I am participating in this program to gain hands-on experience with functional programming, smart contracts, and real-world decentralized application (dApp) development.

 Project Overview

This program aims to:

* Grow the Cardano developer ecosystem.
* Upskill university/college students in Cardano Smart Contract development using Haskell and Plutus.
* Facilitate contributions to open-source projects within the Cardano ecosystem.

 Objectives

* Create blockchain assets (FTs/NFTs).
* Develop and deploy on-chain smart contracts using Haskell Plutus.
* Learn Cardano technologies: CIP-1694, Midnight (ZKP), and Hydra (Midgard).
* Improve problem-solving and functional programming skills.
* Contribute to the Intersect MBO GitHub repositories.
* Promote community-funded Cardano tools and services.

 Courses Structure

 Course A: Beginners (CG-BHP-OC)

* **Haskell Theory (40%)**
* **Plutus Theory (40%)**
* **Cardano Ecosystem (20%)**

 Course B: Intermediate (CG-IHP-OC)

* Builds on Course A
* Adds Haskell & Plutus practicals

 Course C: Advanced (CG-AHP-OC)

* Builds on Courses A & B
* Focuses on real-world dApp production & commercialization

 Certification Criteria

* Complete relevant course modules.
* Build and deploy 2 Real World Applications (RWAs) with integrated on-chain/off-chain code.
* Open source licensing (MIT).
* Mainnet deployment with measurable user adoption and sustainability.

 Developer Environment Requirements

* Install: GHC, Cabal/Nix/Stack, Git, Docker, VS Code, WSL
* Use online Haskell compilers where needed
* Set up Cardano wallets (Nami, Lace, Eternl)
