 Cardano Haskell Plutus University Program - TOBB Technologies

 Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for the Cardano Haskell Plutus University Program. This initiative is part of **Project Catalyst**, the world's largest decentralized innovation engine, and is focused on empowering students globally with Web3 and Cardano blockchain development skills.

My name is **Jeanette Motlokwa**, a student at **TOBB Technologies**, and I am participating in this program to gain hands-on experience with functional programming, smart contracts, and real-world decentralized application (dApp) development.

We are currently running a project approved under Project Catalyst to onboard 16 universities globally. This represents a unique opportunity for TOBB Technologies to be a pioneer and take part in this impactful program.

 Aim

Grow the Cardano developer ecosystem and upskill university/college students in Web3 Cardano Smart Contract development.

 Objectives

* Create blockchain assets (Fungible Tokens, Non-Fungible Tokens).
* Develop and deploy on-chain Smart Contracts using Haskell Plutus.
* Learn Cardano technologies: CIP-1694, Midnight (ZKP), and Hydra (Midgard).
* Improve problem-solving and functional programming skills.
* Provide live support through the Intersect MBO Developer Advocate Program.
* Contribute to Cardano Open Source projects on Intersect GitHub (forks, pull requests, commits, etc.).
* Promote Cardano-funded community tools and services: Cardano Foundation, IOG, Intersect, Emurgo, Gimbalabs, SPOs, and global communities.

---

 Catalyst Output Expectations

* At least 20 students complete the program.
* Each university delivers and showcases at least **2 Real World Applications (RWAs)** using Haskell Plutus.
* RWAs must integrate on-chain & off-chain code, include property-based testing and formal proofs.
* All output licensed under MIT and deployed on preprod testnet.
