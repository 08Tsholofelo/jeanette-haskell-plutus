```haskell
-- FilterEvens.hs
-- Recursive function to filter all even numbers from a list

-- Define the filterEvens function
filterEvens :: [Int] -> [Int]
filterEvens [] = []                                -- Base case
filterEvens (x:xs)
    | even x    = x : filterEvens xs               -- Include even number
    | otherwise = filterEvens xs                   -- Skip odd number

-- Main function to test filterEvens
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Enter a list of integers separated by spaces:"
    input <- getLine
    let numbers = map read (words input) :: [Int]
    let result = filterEvens numbers
    putStrLn ("Even numbers: " ++ unwords (map show result))
```
